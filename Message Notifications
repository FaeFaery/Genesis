Name: Auto: Comms
Type: regexp
Pattern: (The small, black bat flies up to you with a message from (.*).|Postmaster tells you that you have new mail from (.*).|The brown-striped chipmunk scampers up to you with a message from (.*). You carefully remove the note from the tube around its neck.|hands you a letter and says: I have a letter for you from (.*)!|crow suddenly flies in from somewhere, and lands on your shoulder and gives you a message.|A red-winged harrekki descends from above, sinks its talons into your arm, and gives you a message from (.*).)
 
Execute the following javascript:
// To add more messengers to this trigger, here are the steps: 
//Create a new case then make sure to quote the messenger line text. 
//If the sender's name can be found in the text, replace the name with an args. Follow the format that can be seen below: "Text " + args[designated number] + " Remaining text." followed by a colon. The new designated number should follow the number order in the list (So, if you were to add a new line now, the new designated number would be 7 because 1-6 is already taken.) and don't forget the spaces! 
//Then, just paste '$("#addons").text("You got a missive from " + args[designated number] + "!");' and break.
//If the sender cannot be seen, just create a new case, quote the text, add a :, paste '$("#addons").text("You got a missive!");' and break. No added stress of designating an args.
  switch (args[1]){
      case 'The small, black bat flies up to you with a message from ' + args[2]+ '.':
    $("#addons").text("You got a missive from " + args[2] + "!");
        break;
      case 'Postmaster tells you that you have new mail from ' + args[3] + '.':
